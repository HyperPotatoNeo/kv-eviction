"""Segmented forward pass with KV prefix drop between segments.

This is the training-side mirror of vLLM's scheduler-integrated KV cache
compaction. For each compaction boundary the inference engine reported,
we run one forward-pass segment, then drop the oldest
stride_blocks*block_size generation KV entries (and trim the boundary
token), exactly as the inference engine did.

Two operating modes:

1. **Per-segment backward mode (`loss_fn` provided).** The production
   path. Between segments we `.detach()` the retained KV, turning each
   segment into an independent backward-pass unit. The caller supplies
   a `loss_fn` closure that computes the policy loss for just that
   segment's owned token range; after each segment's forward we call
   that closure, run `loss.backward()`, then let autograd tear down
   the graph and free the segment's activations before moving on to
   the next segment. Memory is bounded to O(1 segment) regardless of
   how many compaction events fire. This is the M3 semantic (no cross-
   chunk BPTT, no G_distal term) and it's compatible with FSDP2 and
   prime-rl's per-block activation checkpointing.

2. **Legacy / single-GPU mode (`loss_fn=None`).** Returns the full
   concatenated logits tensor for one final backward at the caller.
   Retained KV is NOT detached between segments, so in principle
   gradients flow backward through the cat chain (BPTT). In practice
   this mode only works under two configurations:
     - Single GPU with `activation_checkpointing=True` (wraps each
       segment's model call in torch.utils.checkpoint externally).
       Useful for offline KL debugging; see smoke #1.
     - Single GPU with no AC at all, on sequences small enough that
       all segment activations fit in memory.
   Under FSDP2 + prime-rl's per-block checkpoint_wrapper, this mode
   deadlocks/errors because torch.utils.checkpoint's non-reentrant
   mode does NOT trigger FSDP2's pre-forward hooks on backward
   re-entry (see plans/phase3_training_integration.md §"Key findings").
   The trainer in production MUST use the per-segment backward mode.

Why the segmentation gives zero train-inference KL mismatch:
- Each segment's forward uses flash_attention_2 (the same kernel vLLM
  uses for decode), so per-segment logits are numerically identical up
  to float precision.
- The KV drop between segments replicates vLLM's eviction exactly
  (same offsets, same trim, same retained identities) so attention
  over retained KV produces the same output as inference.
- Boundary token overlap: the last token of segment k is re-run in
  segment k+1 so its logit (which predicts the first token of the new
  segment) is computed under the post-eviction context, matching what
  inference did when it sampled that token.

Drop boundary is `prompt_aligned_len`, not `prompt_len`, matching the
block-level eviction semantics in vLLM's CompactingKVCacheManager.
Callers pass `prompt_aligned_len` directly; we don't derive it here
because that would require `block_size` as another parameter.

Future work: M4 (BPTT through retained KV, with G_distal gradient term)
requires a cache-snapshot mechanism so torch.utils.checkpoint's
backward re-runs can recover the original pre-mutation cache state.
Not attempted here; we ship M3 first.

        input_ids: Full sequence [1, seq_len] = prompt + completion tokens.
        position_ids: Per-token absolute positions [1, seq_len]. Plain arange
            is correct: RoPE at inference time baked position = prompt_len +
            gen_index, and in this concatenated sequence gen[N] sits at index
            prompt_len + N, so position_ids[i] = i matches inference exactly.
        segment_boundaries: Cumulative completion-token counts at each
            compaction event, in ascending order. Must be non-empty; caller
            is responsible for dispatching to a standard forward when the

        prompt_aligned_len: Block-aligned eviction boundary. Without
            protected prefix: ceil(prompt_len / block_size) * block_size.
            With protected prefix: ceil(min(protected_prefix, prompt_len)
            / block_size) * block_size — can be LESS than prompt_len
            because old conversation turns between the protected prefix
            and the prompt end are evictable. The trainer-side drop must
            match the inference-side boundary exactly or train/inference
            KL explodes.
        stride: Number of tokens evicted per compaction event. In the vLLM
            config this is compaction_stride, a multiple of block_size.
        temperature: Per-token temperatures [1, seq_len] used at generation
            time. Logits are scaled by 1/temperature per-token before being
            concatenated into the final output.
        max_forward_passes: Target forward-pass count for FSDP rank
            synchronization. If greater than the actual number of segments,
            the difference is padded with dummy forward passes that
            contribute to the autograd graph but carry zero gradient weight.
            Must be >= len(segment_boundaries) + 1 when set.
        activation_checkpointing: (Legacy, single-GPU only.) When True,
            each segment's model() call is wrapped in
            torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint(use_reentrant=False). This
            re-materializes segment activations during backward instead

            Must NOT be combined with HF's
            model.gradient_checkpointing_enable() (disables use_cache).
            Must NOT be used under FSDP2 — non-reentrant checkpoint's
            backward re-entry does not trigger FSDP2's pre-forward
            hooks, producing Tensor/DTensor mismatches in RMSNorm.
            Incompatible with loss_fn (only one checkpointing strategy
            at a time).
        loss_fn: (Production path for compaction training.) Per-segment
            loss callback. When provided, the function runs in
            per-segment backward mode: after every `bptt_segments`
            segments' forwards we call backward on the accumulated
            segment losses, detach the retained KV, and move to the
            next BPTT window. Activations from completed segments are
            freed by autograd as each window's backward finishes,
            bounding memory to O(bptt_segments segments). Compatible
            with FSDP2 + prime-rl's per-block AC. Cannot be combined
            with activation_checkpointing=True.
        bptt_segments: Truncation depth (in segments) for truncated
            backpropagation through time. Only meaningful when loss_fn
            is provided. Each BPTT "window" is this many consecutive
            segments; gradients flow through retained KV within a
            window, and the KV is .detach()'d between windows.
                1 (default) = M3 semantics — no cross-chunk BPTT, one
                    backward per segment, O(1 segment) memory.
                K > 1 = TBPTT with depth K segments, O(K segments)
                    memory, gradients span K segments via retained KV.
                None = "full trajectory" — forward every segment in a
                    single window, one backward at the end. Equivalent
                    to M4 gradient semantics (G_distal term intact)
                    but requires O(all segments) memory.
            The final window may be shorter than bptt_segments if the
            total segment count isn't a multiple of bptt_segments.

    Returns:
        - Legacy mode (loss_fn=None):
            {"logits": [1, seq_len, vocab]} — temperature-scaled full

        - Per-segment backward mode (loss_fn provided):
            {"loss": <scalar tensor, detached>, "n_segments": int}
            The scalar is the sum of all per-segment losses (already

        warm up — extension calls inherit via persistent_cache).

        Each event's evict_start is in the CURRENT submitted-prompt-iter
        coordinate (matches `_apply_admission_trim` semantics: each

        because cache content and submitted_prompt are co-indexed up
        through `inherited_end_pre` at the moment of splicing.
      - post_start, post_end: post-trim merged coord (matches
        merged_input_ids / labels / loss_mask / advantages frame).
      - kept_in_call: int64 list of pre-trim positions WITHIN this
        call's contribution that survive admission. Indexed relative to
        call_pre_start. Length = post_end - post_start.
      - new_content_start_in_sub: where this call's NEW pre-trim
        contribution starts within submitted_prompt_ids (0 for first
        call, prior cum_pre for extension calls).

    Asserts no mid-generation events (those are routed to legacy

    Mirrors vLLM exactly: trainer's K cache at any logical position is

    position. The eviction is realized via splice of the persistent_cache
    (the way vLLM evicts in HBM), not by trimming the input tokens (the
    old approach, which broke L1+ K values at the first post-eviction
    slot — see debug/local_kl_diag.py + compare_kv.py).

    For an ADMISSION call (>=1 admission event with tokens_evicted > 0):
      1. Warmup forward over [call_pre_start, inherited_end_pre) — the
         inherited part of submitted_prompt. K cache fills under full
         pre-admission causal attention.
      2. Splice persistent_cache for each admission event in order
         (sequential composition matches _apply_admission_trim).
      3. Main forward over [inherited_end_pre, call_pre_end) — the
         new_user_fragment + completion. Attention sees the spliced cache
         + freshly-written K, matching vLLM's post-admission state.
      4. Concatenate logits: warmup logits (subset to surviving pre-trim
         positions) ++ main logits → length matches the call's post-trim
         contribution to merged_input_ids.

    For an EXTENSION call (no admission, second+ call in a multi-call
    sample): single forward over the call's NEW pre-trim content (the
    tokens beyond what prior calls' forwards already wrote to cache).

    Positions use plain arange + pre-trim absolute offset while the request
    stays in the local frame. When vLLM reports an inherited or
    post-admission position_offset, the trainer switches to the same
    physical-position + piecewise-offset rule the worker uses so cached K
    and newly-written Q/K stay in the writer's RoPE frame.
